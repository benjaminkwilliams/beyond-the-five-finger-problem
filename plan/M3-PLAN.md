# M3 — Graph loop + lead demo + freeze (Wed 2026-10-28, 9:30 AM milestone)

Five-node graph, spec as shared state, structured
records on edges. Nodes:
  GENERATOR — produces frames from a skeleton
    (Sensei sequence) or supplies bench frames.
  PROPOSER — model proposal of per-frame set
    assignments (M1: Spark + sidecar dots).
  CHECKER — deterministic, CPU-only: calibration
    DL (M2.3), boundary budget (M2.4), sequence
    judge (M2.6), proportions (M2.5), facing rings
    (M2.1), masks (M2.2).
  AMENDER — takes a checker FAIL and produces a
    repair instruction in named-set language
    (never a silent re-roll, never a mirror).
    For a role swap: "StarboardLeg is kick in
    all frames; frame N assigns it support —
    regenerate frame N with StarboardLeg kick,
    PortLeg support, facing unchanged."
  BENCH-JUDGE — verdict vs ground truth on bench
    + holdout, never tuned to holdout.

Exit criteria:
- [ ] Graph runs end-to-end on SadPocky v2 9-12:
  swap pair FAILs, neighbours PASS, no smearing.
- [ ] Graph runs on the Sensei GIF drawings:
  2->3 and 4->5 role changes FAIL (the swap
  the user caught 2026-10-27), with an amender
  instruction naming the leg to lock.
- [ ] Readable report in runs/results/report_m3.md.
- [ ] Repo freeze recorded: commit + push, freeze
  state in this plan.

Open, recorded 2026-10-27: generated drawings
carry no side markers, so a proposer cannot
assign Starboard/Port from the drawing alone —
the Sensei GIF verdict is by human role reading,
not by proposer assignment, until markers are
in the drawing (character-data layer, deferred).
